-- =====================================================

-- Policy to ensure users can only comment on existing posts

-- Configure realtime subscriptions for live updates

-- Enable realtime for community features
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE community_posts;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE comments;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE post_likes;

-- PERFORMANCE INDEXES FOR RLS
-- =====================================================
-- Additional indexes to optimize RLS policy performance

-- Index for user_id lookups in RLS policies
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_nutrition_assessments_user_rls ON nutrition_assessments(user_id) WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_food_recommendations_user_rls ON food_recommendations(user_id) WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_post_likes_user_rls ON post_likes(user_id) WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Composite indexes for common RLS + business logic queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_recommendations_user_assessment_rls ON food_recommendations(user_id, assessment_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_comments_post_user_rls ON comments(post_id, user_id);

-- SECURITY NOTES AND DOCUMENTATION
-- =====================================================

/*
SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

1. PROFILE ACCESS:
   - All users can view profiles (needed for community features)
   - Users can only modify their own profile data
   - Profile creation is tied to auth.uid() ensuring ownership

2. PRIVATE DATA ACCESS:
   - Nutrition assessments and food recommendations are private
   - Users can only access their own assessment and recommendation data
   - Assessment-recommendation relationship is validated

3. COMMUNITY DATA ACCESS:
   - Posts, comments, and likes are publicly readable (community features)
   - Users can only create/modify/delete their own content
   - Cross-references are validated (comments on existing posts, etc.)

4. REFERENCE DATA ACCESS:
   - Food data is read-only for authenticated users
   - Prevents anonymous access while allowing all authenticated users to read

5. REALTIME FEATURES:
   - Community tables are enabled for realtime subscriptions
   - Allows live updates for posts, comments, and likes

6. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - RLS-specific indexes optimize policy checks
   - Composite indexes support common query patterns
   - Helper functions reduce policy complexity

7. ADMIN ACCESS:
   - Admin operations (like food data management) should be done through direct DB access
   - Consider creating admin roles if needed in the future

DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
- ✅ RLS enabled on all tables
- ✅ Policies created for all CRUD operations
- ✅ Cross-reference validation policies
- ✅ Performance indexes for RLS
- ✅ Realtime publications configured
- ✅ Helper functions created
- ✅ Security documentation provided

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Test user isolation (users cannot access other users' private data)
- Test community features (users can read all public data)
- Test cross-reference validation (comments on valid posts only)
- Test realtime subscriptions work correctly
- Test performance with RLS policies enabled
